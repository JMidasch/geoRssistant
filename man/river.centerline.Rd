\title{Extract River Centerline}
\usage{
river.centerline(input_raster, threshold = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_raster}{Path to the input DEM file in GeoTIFF format (`.tif`).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Flow accumulation threshold to define river networks. Cells with flow accumulation values above this threshold are considered part of the river network. Defaults to `1000`.}
}
\value{
A `SpatVector` object containing the river centerlines as vector geometries.
}
\description{
This function processes a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to extract river centerlines
by simulating water flow and determining areas of significant flow accumulation.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Fills depressions in the DEM to ensure continuous flow simulation using the D8 algorithm.
2. Computes flow accumulation across the DEM.
3. Identifies river networks by applying a flow accumulation threshold.
4. Converts the identified river raster into a vector of centerlines (line geometries).

Intermediate products, such as the filled DEM and flow accumulation raster, are saved with filenames
derived from the input DEM. If these files already exist, they are reused to save computation time on reruns.

\dontrun{
# Extract river centerlines from a DEM with a flow accumulation threshold of 1000
rivers <- river.centerline(input_raster = "path_to_dem.tif", threshold = 1000)

# Save the vectorized river network
writeVector(rivers, "river_centerlines.shp", filetype = "ESRI Shapefile")
